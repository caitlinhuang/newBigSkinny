      <p class="lead">Big Skinny</p>
      <p>Big Skinny / (big skin’ e) / adj./ 1. the most thin. 2. (noun/ slang) insider information; truth, the most important fact(s) or reason(s), e.g. ''What's the Big Skinny on your hot Bulgarian supermodel friend?" Or, "Don't mess around; just give me the Big Skinny."</p>
      <p class="lead">Motivation</p>
      <p>Hate THICK wallets? For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for a thin wallet. I tried every advertised thin wallet and then everything else to keep my cash and cards organized together and to avoid having that uncomfortable and unsightly brick in my pocket. I felt like George Costanza with his wallet problems from the famous Seinfeld TV episode. I couldn't find anything that worked or even looked good; in reality, perhaps I was really looking for the anti-wallet.</p>

      <p class="lead">The Cure</p>
      <p>Finally in frustration, I designed the original thin Big Skinny sport wallet. It took almost 2 years of testing dozens of designs and over 75 natural and man-made materials searching for the right balance of "thin wallet" yet with good looks, functionality, and durability. Using an advanced version of the stylish nylon micro-fiber material (5 to 7 times thinner than leather) that made Prada famous along with the special design resulted in a slim wallet so unique that I just had to name it. Imagine a well-organized slim wallet that you barely notice yet is good-looking and can fit 20+ credit cards plus bills.

      <p>Big Skinny wallets were originally designed by Kiril Stefan Alexandrov because he loathed sitting on a thick, heavy leather wallet. He created one basic model [the Sport Wallet] in 2005. Dozens of wallet styles have since been added and more are on the way. Kiril’s entrepreneurial background includes founding multiple businesses in the Boston area.
